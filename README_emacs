Welcomes you with this:

Welcome to ENSIME!

ENSIME is more complex than a typical Emacs plugin and interacts
with an external java application (which is downloaded by your
build tool plugin).

You are strongly recommended to read the documentation at

* http://ensime.org/getting_started/
* http://ensime.org/editors/emacs/
* http://ensime.org/getting_help/

before proceeding.

We are all volunteers with our own priorities to improve ENSIME.
Our approach to feature requests is that we will enthusiastically
help you to implement or fix it. The ENSIME codebase is
surprisingly easy to understand and you are invited to read the
contributing guide and jump in: http://ensime.org/contributing/

You can disable this message permanently by setting
`ensime-startup-notification' to `nil', acknowledging
